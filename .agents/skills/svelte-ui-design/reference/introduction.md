# Introduction

Learn more about Skeleton and how it can serve you.

## In a Nutshell

**Design System**: Skeleton augments Tailwind CSS by providing themes, styled elements, and guardrails for integrating a comprehensive design system.

**Components**: Turnkey components built on [Zag.js](https://zagjs.com/) that automatically adapt to the Skeleton design system. Currently available for Svelte and React.

## Our Philosophy

**Framework Agnostic**: Core features require only Tailwind CSS, enabling standardization across your chosen framework.

**Native-First**: Skeleton embraces semantic HTML and native browser APIs rather than replacing web standards, supporting accessibility.

**Simple Standards**: Provides common conventions for themes, colors, typography, spacing, and related design fixtures.

**Utility-First**: Embraces utility-first methodology, supporting Tailwind features while extending capabilities for modern web components.

**Opt-In by Default**: Most features are modular and optional, allowing customization when needed.

**Adaptive**: Designed to fit your project's aesthetic with sensible defaults and a powerful [theme generator](https://themes.skeleton.dev/).
