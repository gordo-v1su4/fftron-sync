## Mixing UI Libraries

Skeleton's design system works well alongside headless component libraries including:

- Bits UI
- Melt UI
- Radix
- Zag.js

It also integrates with Tailwind component libraries like Tailwind Plus, provided they support Tailwind styling and allow custom utility class insertion.

## Unsupported Libraries

The following libraries cannot currently integrate with Skeleton:

- **Flowbite React**
- **Flowbite Svelte**
- **Daisy UI**

These libraries modify Tailwind CSS in ways that conflict with Skeleton's core functionality, including overlapping class names and color value definitions.
